In other words, they mean the same as omitting them (i.e., no constraint given).\r\nMy point here is that this may be not entirely obvious to readers, so I suggest pointing this out **explicitly** in the spec.\r\n*  ~In negative contexts, with the\u00a0semantics defined so far, AFAICS, all-zero masks also lead to \"**pass all**\"\r\n    (or am I wrong on that? If so, please explain, also in the draft text).\r\n    This may be not what is desired from a specification point of view, and they could easily be misunderstood by users.\r\n    Therefore, also to enhance expressiveness of these constraints,\r\n    I suggest explicitly defining for negative contexts a different(!) semantics, namely:\r\n    an all-zero mask in\u00a0negative context means **rejection** of all MAC addresses of either 6 or 8 bytes length, depending on the length of the constraint.\r\n    This way, things would become very clear, and would add support for allowing **only** 8-byte or 6-byte MAC addresses, respectively. Could it be of interest to be able to express and use this type of constraint?~",
